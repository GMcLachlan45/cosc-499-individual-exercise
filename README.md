# cosc-499-individual-exercise

# Features

A short program for COSC 499. Takes in a string from the user, and performs one of the following sorts:

### Sorting by Words in the String

Takes the user's input as a string, sorts all of the words contained in the string in alphabetical order, and outputs the result as a string. As an example:

`Hi my name is Albert`

will return

`albert hi is my name`

For more examples be sure to take a look at tests/TestSortingByWord.java

### Sorting by Characters in the String

Takes the user's input as a string, sorts all of the characters in alphabetical order, and outputs the result as a string. As an example:

`Hi my name is Greg`

will return

`aeegghiimmnrsy`

For more examples, be sure to take a look at tests/TestSortingByCharacter.java

## Setup
To use this mini application, pull the repo to Eclipse's `src` folder.

From there, select "app/MainFile.java", and click the Run button.
Alternatively you can use 

`	javac app/MainFile.java`

`	java app/MainFile.java`

## Testing
The test suite itself only works in Eclipse as far as I know. 

To test, navigate to the desired test in "./tests/" and click the Run button.
