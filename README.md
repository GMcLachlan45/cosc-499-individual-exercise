# cosc-499-individual-exercise
A short program for COSC 499

## Setup
To use this mini application, pull the repo to Eclipse's `src` folder.

From there, select "app/MainFile.java", and click the Run button.
Alternatively you can use 

`	javac app/MainFile.java`

`	java app/MainFile.java`

## Testing
The test suite itself only works in Eclipse as far as I know. 

To test, navigate to the desired test in "./tests/" and click the Run button.
